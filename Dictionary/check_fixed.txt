adapt 

the group nearest to warpin aggresses as you bland destroying 
this group trigger commanded wave destroying the reinforcement wave from group 3 is most likely second escalation trigger 

each group aggresses when approached or attacked groups 3 and 4 are far enough that they will not aggress unless specifically 
approached and can be ignored group 4 spawn differently sometimes 
it may have 2 cruisers and 2 battlecruisers or 3 cruisers 

the first three location are generally in high security space and last in low security space but this can vary 
the first three location can be done in a t1 frigate at orange though for the last location a high das destroyed or a cruise is advised 
throughout this last fight 
your radar equipment has been busy chewing on information about oncoming and outgoing vessels and it seems it has traced a very 
large group of ships that left this place few minutes before you arrived you have no clue why they cleft were they fleeing
