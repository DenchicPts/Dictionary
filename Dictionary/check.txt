The group nearest to warpin aggresses as you land. Destroying
this group triggers commander wave. Destroying the reinforcement wave from group 3 is most likely second escalation trigger.

Each group aggresses when approached or attacked. Groups 3 and 4 are far enough that they will not aggress unless specifically
approached and can be ignored. Group 4 spawns differently sometimes, 
it may have 2 cruisers and 2 battlecruisers or 3 cruisers.

The first three locations are generally in high security space and last in low security space but this can vary.
The first three locations can be done in a T1 frigate at range, though for the last location a high DPS destroyer or a cruiser is advised.
Throughout this last fight, 
your radar equipment has been busy chewing on information about incoming and outgoing vessels and it seems it has traced a very
large group of ships that left this place few minutes before you arrived. You have no clue why they left, were they fleeing? 
Or was it a coincidence? Either way, there is only one way to find out.
Mare Sargassum is an expedition found by completing Desolate Site combat sites.
It may contain up to four parts.
The first three will be in high-sec space, while the fourth can be in low-sec or high-sec.
The sites do not have gates, and can be easily completed in a cruise
The initial defenders can vary wildly.

The initial defenders consists of around 6 frigates and one sentient drone.
